Factorial means the product of an integer and all the integers below it.

Example 1 :-
Factorial of 5 , how do you get it

1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5 = 120 (until 5 you have to multiply)

so 120 is the factorial of 5.

Example 2 :-
Factorial of 6 :-

1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5 X 6 = 720 (until 6 you have to multiply)

so 720 is the factorial of 6.
